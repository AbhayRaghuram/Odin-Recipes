# Odin-Recipes
The Odin Project: Practice Project

In this project, I am going to build a basic recipe website.
The Recipes are random, since the main purpose of this project is to practice my HTML skills.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. 
The website won’t look very pretty by the time it's finished. 

But it’s important to keep in mind that this project is just to build my HTML chops; I will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.
